This is a port of an old iOS game "Fidus Fidus" to JavaScript.

The game is spin on the classic falling block action puzzles like Puyo Puyo and Tetris. New version has keyboard controls (left-right-up-down and space).

Here is a video of the original game play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxy-Rt7CpoU
